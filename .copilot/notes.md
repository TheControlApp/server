# Agent Tracking and Context

This directory contains files used by AI agents to track context and maintain consistency across conversations.

## Files:
- `notes.md` - Current project state and decisions
- `action_log.md` - History of actions taken by agents

## Purpose:
This helps maintain consistency when multiple agents work on the project or when conversations span multiple sessions.
